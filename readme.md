# Fizbot (name pending)

## Setup

Requires ruby 2+. It should be fine with minor versions. Make sure your `SLACK_API_TOKEN` isn't the same one used for Fizbot in Slack. I strongly believe this will cause lots of double messages.

- `bundle`
- `ruby bot.rb`

## Deploying

Right now this isn't set up in CI. So I manually deploy any updates whenever the #questions channel seems inactive (usually post midnight on Sunday).
